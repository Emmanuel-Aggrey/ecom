            XtayConnect Africa started as a Research into other products that could rely on the internet to provide support for the unsupported mass in 2018. It was incorporated as Ekol XtayConnect Enterprise in the early part of 2020 and later changed to Ekol XtayConnect Africa Limited in the Republic of Ghana. 

            The research found its way into Products’ Development and relied on the technologies from the Fourth Industrial Revolutions (4IR) to provide technology and smart solutions that could stand the test of time and aid the majority of people in Africa become relevant with little commitments. 
            
            The company aims to provide and rely on internet related gadgets and devices to include rural and peri-urban, middle and low class folks enjoy same or similar services as is by the high earning class in a number of countries in Africa beginning from Ghana.
            
            The flagship product, Smart TV Boxes, come as either an Android Set Top Box, 4G LTE STB (Capable of Accepting SIM Cards), a Digital Hybrid STB, in a bid to bring services such as Online Studies/E-Learning, Web Search Engines, IPTV Apps like Netflix, YouTube and Games to the TV screen without the need for a smart TV. The set top box also has an inbuilt Android platform, which supports 4K/6K contents and downloadable apps, along with TV channels.
            This may become the first hybrid OTT Set Top Box powered by Android Platform TV to be launched in the Ghana and Sub Saharan Africa;
            Notably, when Telcos and the Government through the Ministries of Communication and Education in collaboration with the Educational Institutions/Content providers adopt this as a means to provide an equal opportunity for the all; privileged & less privileged individuals will gain access to Online Contents (E-Learning/Online Studies, Entertainment), the ‘INEVITABLE NEW NORMAL’ post Covid 19.
            The TV set top box is 4K/6K content ready, and enables live contents to be paused, recorded or even rewind. Users will need to insert a USB pen drive to record content, and can use an SD card to save downloaded apps.
            There is an in-built Wi-Fi feature that connects with your home network or even your mobile hotspot if required. Users can also connect Bluetooth headsets, keyboards, and controllers.
            Growing broadband penetration is driving the popularity of online content, particularly in urban homes, and with this Android TV Box, we are bringing excellent content from the web and much more to the TV screen, an all-round solution.
            The long-term vision for XtayConnect Africa is to increase the Internet penetration/usage rate in especially Sub-Saharan Africa and to reduce Internet access costs by investing in the needed partnership and advanced-yet relatively cheaper infrastructure and devices.
